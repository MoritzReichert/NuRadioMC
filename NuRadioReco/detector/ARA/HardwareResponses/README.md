# Here we have added the latest gain measurements for A2&A3 (https://aradocs.wipac.wisc.edu/0026/002650/001/20220902_Gain_Workshop.pdf)
  - different configuration schemes based on different period of time
  - A2 has 6 configuratons and A3 has 7 configurations
  - the gain models for A1, A4 & A5 are under development and will be updated as soon as they become available
  - each *configuration*.txt file contains 33 columns - 0th column contains frequency, even numbered columns contain phase values and odd numbered columns contain gain values
  - the existing gain file(used for all stations) is renamed as default and other than defined A2/A3 configurational period, all simulation will still use this gain
